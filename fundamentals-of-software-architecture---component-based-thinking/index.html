# Fundamentals of Software Architecture - Component-Based Thinking

---

# What is a component?

--

> physical manifestation of a module

--

- jar in java

--

- dll in .NET

--

- gem in ruby

--

I would argue a gradle submodule would also count

--

- Deployable unit of work, e.g. a service or event processor

--

One can work without components, but it is often very useful

---

# An architects role

--

- Manage components 

--

- Designing classes and functions is a responsibility of engineers

--

- Architecture is generally separate from the process

---

# Architecture partitioning

--

- Layered architecture 

--

- Modular monolith

---

# Architecture partitioning

--

## Technical partitioning

--

- makes it easy to find code for technical concepts

--

- having teams of a single role, e.g. backend engineer, DBA, etc

--

## Domain partitioning

--

- makes it easy to find a domain

--

- having cross functional teams

--

- microservices are based on this style

--

- can have sub-components

---

# Component identification flow

--

- Identifying initial components

--

- Assign requirements to components

--

- Analyze roles and responsibilities

--

- Analyze architecture characteristics

--

- Restructure components

---

# Component granularity

--

- Too fine grained leads to too much communication

--

- Too coarse grained leads to high internal coupling

---

# Entity trap

--

Building an ORM instead of architecture

--

Naked objects, Isis etc work in this area

---

# Structured approaches

--

- Actors/actions  approach

--

- Event storming

--

- Workflow approach

--

If no specific requirements, actors/actions approach is solid

---

# Example

--

- Requirements can be different depending on actor in the same domain, e.g. bidder vs  auctioneer

--

- Can help decide architectural styles, e.g. monolith vs distributed, distributed preferable in this case
