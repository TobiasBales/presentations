# An introduction to GitHub actions

---

# language

--

We are going to start by defining words so that we share a vocabulary

---

# step

--

A .highlight[step] is the smallest unit of work

--

It can either be a defined action or a small script/command

---

# job

--

A .highlight[job] groups .highlight[multiple steps] into a larger unit

--

it could for example

--

- clone a repository

--

- install dependencies

--

- build a docker image

--

- push the docker image

---

# workflow

--

A .highlight[workflow] groups .highlight[multiple jobs] into a yet again larger unit

--

it could for example

--

- run tests

--

- run linters

--

- build and push a docker image

--

all of those steps can run at the same time or in a defined order

---

# secrets

--

A .highlight[secret] is something that is needed by worksflows but should part of the git repository

--

They are mostly injected as environment variables

--

They can be either on the scope of a repository or the whole organization

---

# How does this look like?

--

All examples can be found at 

https://www.github.com/TobiasBales/github-actions-examples

---

# Running actions locally

--

You can actually do this using the `act` cli

--

Finally build a new pipeline without 12312378 commits

---

# Custom actions

--

You can build actions easily

--

They can be either private or public (which is nice)

--

@Jorge did so to improve slack notifications

---

# Slack notifications

--

Absolutely - there are actions for it

--

Thanks to @Jorge you can also have them just when a build breaks or recovers

---

# Obvious questions

--

**Can it do everything?**

--

No, you can build pipelines but the visualization of dependencies does not exist

--

**Does it do everything travis does?**

--

Yes, and more*

--

**Should I immediatelly migrate everything?**

--

The wonderland now uses GH actions successfully

The CMS team is currently evaluating GHA with the SRE team

We should have a clearer picture in 2-3 weeks, so hold off for a tad longer
