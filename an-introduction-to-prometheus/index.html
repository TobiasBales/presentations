# An introduction to Prometheus

---

# So what is Prometheus?

--

> An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

---

# An .highlight[open-source]

--

It's open source, that's good

---

# An open-source .highlight[monitoring system]

--

It is used for monitoring

---

# An open-source monitoring system .highlight[with a dimensional data model]

--

This is going to be a bit more complicated

---

# Multidimensional data model

--

Measuring the number of http requests


`http_requests 0`

--

Add a couple of http requests

`GET / HTTP/1.1`  
`GET / HTTP/1.1`  
`GET / HTTP/1.1`

--

Results in

`http_requests 3`

---

# Multidimensional data model

Tracking response status

`GET / HTTP/1.1`  -> `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`  
`GET / HTTP/1.1`  -> `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`  
`GET / HTTP/1.1`  -> `HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests`  

--

Results in

`http_requests{code="200"} 2`  
`http_requests{code="429"} 1`

--

But it is called .highlight[multidimensional] data model

---

# Multidimensional data model


Tracking request method and response status code

`GET / HTTP/1.1`  -> `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`  
`GET / HTTP/1.1`  -> `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`  
`POST / HTTP/1.1`  -> `HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed`  
`PUT / HTTP/1.1`  -> `HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed`  
`GET / HTTP/1.1`  -> `HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests`  

--

Results in

`http_requests{method="GET", code="200"} 2`  
`http_requests{method="GET", code="429"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="POST", code="405"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="PUT", code="405"} 1`

---

# An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, .highlight[flexible query langue]

---

# Querying data

Given

`http_requests{method="GET", code="200"} 2`  
`http_requests{method="GET", code="429"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="POST", code="405"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="PUT", code="405"} 1`

--

All requests that resulted in a response status of 200

`http_requests{code="200"}`

--

Results in

`{method="GET", code="200"} 2`

---

# Querying data

Given

`http_requests{method="GET", code="200"} 2`  
`http_requests{method="GET", code="429"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="POST", code="405"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="PUT", code="405"} 1`

--

All GET requests by code

`http_requests{method="GET"}`

--

Results in

`{method="GET", code="200"} 2`  
`{method="GET", code="429"} 1`

---

# Querying data

Given

`http_requests{method="GET", code="200"} 2`  
`http_requests{method="GET", code="429"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="POST", code="405"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="PUT", code="405"} 1`


--

All GET requests

`sum(http_requests{method="GET"})`

--

Results in

`{method="GET"} 3`  

---

# An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query langue, .highlight[efficient time series database]

--

We have been looking at metrics at a single point in time

--

Prometheus keeps track of all metrics, including all label combinations, over time

---

# An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query langue, efficient time series database .highlight[and modern alerting approach]

---

# Old school alerting

--

- CPU > x%
- Disk usage > y%
- Memory usage > z%

--

Very little insight into what is happening

---

# Modern alerting

--

More than 0.05% of all http requests are errors (50x status code)

--

`sum(http_requests{code=~"50\d"}) / sum(http_requests) > 0.0005`

--

Disk usage will be exceed 90% in 24 hours with linear growth

--

`linear_predict(disk_space_used, 60 * 60 * 24) > disk_space_total * 0.9`

---

# Modern alerting

--

## Alert manager

--

Part of Prometheus

--

Uses PromQL to define alerts

--

Can trigger pretty much every external service (e.g. slack, pager duty)

---

# Using it

--

Sounds cool, but how do I actually use this?

---

# Metric ingestion

--

Prometheus is a pull-based system

--

It asks your services for metrics

--

In the wonderland it asks each service once a minute

---

# Metric ingestion

In `wonderland.yaml`

```yaml
prometheus:
  - component: <name-of-the-component-that-exposes-metrics>
    container-port: <port-that-exposes metrics>
```

--

URL path is always `/metrics`

--

Port should be different from application, don't expose them to the internet

---

# Metric ingestion

So what does your service need to respond with for this to work?

--

You saw it earlier already


`http_requests{method="GET", code="200"} 2`  
`http_requests{method="GET", code="429"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="POST", code="405"} 1`  
`http_requests{method="PUT", code="405"} 1`

--

But please use one of the available **client libraries**

---

# Metric types

--

Prometheus has 4 different types of metrics

--

So far we have looked at a counter

--

All of them serve different purposes

---

# Counter

--

A monotonically increasing value that can be reset to 0

--

for example
- number of http requests served
- tasks completed
- errors

---

# Gauge

--

A single numerical value

--

Contrary to a counter it can decrease

--

for example
- current temperature
- memory usage
- number of concurrent requests

---

# Histogram

Samples observations and counts them into buckets

--

for example
- request duration
- response size

--

generated metrics for a `request_duration_seconds` histogram

```
request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.010"} 3
request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.050"} 7
request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.250"} 8
request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="1.500"} 9
request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="+Inf"} 10
request_duration_seconds_sum 5592
request_duration_seconds_count 10
```

--

allows looking at quantiles of values

0.5 quantile/50th percentile of request durations over the last 5 minutes
`histogram_quantile(0.5, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`

0.95 quantile/95th percentile of request durations over the last 5 minutes
`histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))`

---

# Summaries

--

Similar to histograms

--

Instead of configuring buckets by values they are configured by wanted quantiles and time windows (e.g. 0.5 and 5m)

--

Does not allow for ad-hoc changing of quantiles

--

Calculation done by service providing metrics instead of Prometheus server

---

# Visualizing metrics

--

We use grafana to visualize the metrics

--

.image-100[![](./images/grafana.png)]

---

# Best practices

--

When using Prometheus there are a couple of things to keep in mind

--

This makes your life easier

--

but also ours ;)

---

# Limit label and metric cardinality

--

Always consider the number of labels a metric has (metric cardinality)
and the number of values a label can have (label cardinality)

--

1 label with 3 possible values means keeping track of 3 metrics

--

2 labels with 3 possible values each means keeping track of 9 metrics

--

3 labels with 3 possible values each means keeping track of 27 metrics

--

3 labels with 10 possible values each means keeping track of 1000 metrics

---

# Limit label and metric cardinality

We keep track of all metrics for 30 days

--

One data point for each metric each minute for each service

--

A label cardinality of a couple thousand is the upper limit

---

# Naming metrics

--

Counts should end in `_count`

--

If it is not a count it should include the unit that is being measured, e.g. `request_duration_seconds`
